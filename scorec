# SCOREC-SCRIPT
# DANIEL W. ZAIDE, 01/11/2015
# This script is used to pick a machine on scorec to use 
# Based on free CPU with minimum memory
# Memory can be user specified in GB
# If no value specified, 2 GB is used
# Computers traversed in random order, to avoid bias 
# If free CPU is greater than 80%, that machine is chosen
# Usage: scorec 
# Usage: scorec 8.5
